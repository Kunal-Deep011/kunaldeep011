    <h1>About Indian Army</h1>
    <p>
        The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest 
        component of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India 
        is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army,[3] and its professional head is 
        the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers 
        have been conferred with the rank of field marshal, a five-star rank, 
        which is a ceremonial position of great honour. The Indian Army was formed in 
        1895 alongside the long established presidency armies of the East India Company, 
        which too were absorbed into it in 1903. The princely states had their own armies, 
        which were merged into the national army after independence. The units and regiments 
        of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have participated in several battles and 
        campaigns around the world, earning many battle and theatre honours before and after Independence.
